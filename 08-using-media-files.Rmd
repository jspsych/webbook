# Using Media Files: Images, Audio, and Video

## Experiment: Matrix Reasoning

Each trial contains a matrix of shapes, with one cell missing. Below each matrix stimulus is a set of options for the shape that could fill the empty cell in the matrix. The participant must decide which option would correctly fit in the empty cell by examining the relationships across the shapes in the matrix. The participant responds by clicking on a shape option.
